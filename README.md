SMP Challenge is an annual challenge that seeks excellent research teams on new ways of forecasting problems and meaningfully improving peopleâ€™s social lives and business scenarios. The enormous amounts of online content lead to overconsumption, online word-of-mouth helps us to efficiently discover interesting news, emerging topics, the latest stories, or amazing products from the information ocean. Therefore, predicting online popularity became an emerging and significant task for online media, brand marketing, social influencers, or our individuals. We formulated this task as the Social Media Popularity Prediction. It focuses on predicting the impact of online post sharing on social media. It is central to various scenarios, such as online advertising, social recommendation, demand forecasting, etc.


## [SMPD Dataset](https://smp-challenge.com/download.html)  
Social Media Prediction Dataset (SMPD) is a massive-scale, multimodal, and temporal dataset with over 486K social multimedia posts from 70K users and various social media information including anonymized photo-sharing records, user profiles, images, texts, times, or other metadata. SMPD is collected from Flickr's online streams. For keeping temporal properties, we conducted a chronological split for training and testing data (commonly, by date and time).

| Dataset | Posts |  Users |  Categories  |  Time Range (Months) | Tags |
| :----:  |    :----:   |    :----:   |    :----:   |    :----:   |    :----:   |
| SMPD  | 486K  | 70K | 756 | 16  | 29  | 250K  |
