# SMP Challenge (Social Media Prediction)

Homepage: https://smp-challenge.com

SMP Challenge is a series of annual challenges on ACM Multimedia Conference for social media prediction. We are seeking excellent research teams to provide novel method for social multimedia forecasting problem in human social life and business scenarios. We released a large-scale Social Media Prediction Dataset (SMPD) with over 486K posts, 70K users and rich information including user profiles, images, texts, times, locations, and categories. This year the challenge will be again hosted by the joint team from multiple research organizations.
